## Introduction

- Who am I?
- Why am I doing this?
- What are you looking to get out of this?
- What we **won't** talk about this presentation

note: We are not talking about: other cryptocurrency, ETFs, technical jargon, monetary theory, humanitarian / moral implication of monetary control, the environment. If you wanted to talk bout Javier Mieli, the SEC, OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, Mises, the history of monetary oppression, or how ASICS are may be leading us to sustainable energy, you are in the wrong place.

# The Punch Line

By learning how to send, receive, and keep your **bitcoin** secure, you can safely join the future of money with little risk.

By dollar cost averaging you remove psychological risk from investing into your long term investments.

# What is Bitcoin?

- Bitcoin = the network
- bitcoin = the money
- Cryptocurrency = cryptography + currency
- Open source = https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin
- It's an experiment testing a new paradigm 

---

# What is a satoshi?

- $1 USD = 100 cents
- â‚¿1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis

notes: There are also finneys, bits, nano-bitcoin, and millibitcoin, but are rarely used. Satoshis can even be broken down further through some clever computer sicne.

--- 
## What is Bitcoin not

- Impossible to understand
- "Old"
- Illegal*

*as of 2024-01-17**

note: you are not late. Saying you're late today is like saying it's too light to learn how to use PayPal.

## Engine

**First ask question about the how to drive. Then, ask about the engine so that you can maintain your vehicle**

**The rest of this presentation is how to drive**

# How to Receive Bitcoin

1. Wallet = where your bitcoins are secured
	- Allows you to store, receive, and send bitcoin
2. Another wallet to send you bitcoin
	- Yourself
	- Someone else

I  recommend Blue Wallet: https://bluewallet.io/

# What is an adress

- In your wallet, you need to provide the sender a bitcoin address
- Typically done with a QR code, you can also provide the text address below it if you're not in the same room
- Example:
- `bc1qymgj60vqazcxds9ar9fqalwajdzryudaypuwqd`

# How to Send Bitcoin

1. Have a wallet with bitcoin in it
2. Scan the QR code or insert the address
3. Select the fee amount

# What are transaction Fees

Transaction Fees at 2024-01-17 19:00 EST:

![[transaction-fee-2024-01-17.png]]

note: If you would like to avoid fees, look into the "off chain" or "layer 2 solutions", such as the lightning network

--- 
# How to Keep Bitcoin Safe

- The first question is how much do you want to have?
- Would you spend $100 to protect $100?
- Your level of security depends on how much you are protecting.

---

#  What is a seed phrase

- If someone wanted to pretend they are you, what would they need to access your bank account? = A lot of your information
- Your bitcoin is protected by cryptography. You need to keep these words safe.

![[seed-phrase-example.png]]

note: These words are randomly generated. Do not chose them as it would be easy to hack as human minds are not good sources of randomness.

---

#  What should you do with this seed phrase?

- Keep it safe
- Keep it offline
- Have backups in it
- If it's a lot of money, increase security
